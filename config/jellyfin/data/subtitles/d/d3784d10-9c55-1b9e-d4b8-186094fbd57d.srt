00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,920

No, I'm good. Thank you.

128
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,880

Ulle Dag Charles, what is this

129
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,400
mysterious new software, River?

130
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,720
River is a revolutionary
technology...

131
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,880
Er, how's the paper?

132
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,480
I finally came up with
a new title for it, actually.

133
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,560
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
What is it?

134
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:47,600
It's called, "Problematic
Violences and Self-Authorship:

135
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,360
Traps of the Messianic
and the Tragic."

00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,720
Come on, you learned firearms,
you know what it means.

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,040
Where's Jasmine? Homework?

140
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,400

Why is a man who is a founder member

141
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,960

against his fellow billionaires?

You should be all over this.

144
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,400

145
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,440
Some people think he's God.
Yeah, including him.

146
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,520
- Look at him.
- You never know
with this guy, though.

147
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,840
I mean, if this software does
what it's supposed to,

148
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,120
it's gonna show us where
all the big money's coming from

149
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,960
and where it goes.
Like, if he pulls this off,

150
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,440
this could get really interesting.

151
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,080
But it's not interesting right now.
Someone's been assassinated.

152
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,360
It is to me.
Can you ju...

153
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,400
No! Listen,
you can't just come here...

154
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,880
Give me it.
Come home... Fine, fine, fine.

155
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,320
Take it. Wow, no respect
for your husband, no?

156
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,240
Thank you.

157
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,440
According to police sources,
Fest was struck by a single bullet

158
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,360
fired by a sniper from long range.

159
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,840
It's not yet confirmed
if authorities

160
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,480
have been able
to locate a suspect or...

161
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,840

171
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,160

the day prior.

172
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,960
I offered. She wants you.

173

between these incidents,

174
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,480
forming a broader conspiracy
against the Fest family.

175

Ja.

176
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,480
Do you know, this is the first time
that I've ever been asked

177
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,400
for a passport crossing
between Germany and France.

178
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,840
Where are you coming from?
Er, Nuremberg.

179
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,120
Do you live in Nuremberg?

180
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,320
Er, no, I live in Paris.
What were you doing in Nuremberg?

181
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,760
I was visiting someone on business.

182
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,360
Is this your car?
No, it's a rental.

183
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,600
Open the boot.

184
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Open it, please.

185
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,240
What's happening here?

186
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,280
Nothing to worry about.

187
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,560
What's in the box?

188
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,160
Ah, so this...

189
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,640
is why I was in Nuremberg.

190
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,440
This...

191
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,040
is a Jaques set.

192
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,960
The ivory is all pre-ban.

193
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,240
And it's, er...
it's incredibly rare.

194
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,280
I collect these things.

195
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,040
Wait here.

196
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,720
You can go.
Thank you very much.

197
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,960
Have a great evening.

198
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,480
Thank you.

00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,080
Er, the report's
literally just come in.

217
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,840
Should be on your screen now.

218
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,680
Single shot to the head.
A lot of splatter.

219
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,640
Bloody good shot.

220
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,880
No, that can't be right.
What?

221
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,640
3,815 metres.

222
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,720
But that... that's not possible.

223
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,720
Well, it's what
the Germans are saying.

224
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,360
And we know how precise
the Germans are.

225
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,160
What's-What's going on?
They've called a meeting about it.

226
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,880
Osi. Osi.

227
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,040
I should be at the Fest meeting.

228
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,280
You'll get a full briefing
- afterwards.
- No, no, no, no.

229
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,920
I don't want a full briefing.
Snipers is my patch.

230
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:56,440
I didn't draw up the names, Bianca.
Well, wait, wait, wait.

231
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,480
Who did? Was it Isabel?
I assume so.

232
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,600
Well... Look. Jordan's in there.

233
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,640
Jordan.
What does Jordan know about snipers?

234
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,160
I have to be in there.

235
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,440
Who is that anyway?

236
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,560
Werner Leckner, German Intelligence.

237
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,160
Last night there were arson attacks

238
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,640
on mosques in Hamburg,
Berlin and Dresden.

239
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,200
And there's been rioting
in different parts of the country.

240
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,160
It's obviously very alarming,
Werner.

241
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,280
And as you know,
the Foreign Secretary

242
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,920
was a personal friend of the Fest
family. He's very shocked.

243
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,320
As are we all.
What do you need from us?

244
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,040
We are not making any assumptions

245
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,280
about the nationality
of the sniper,

246
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,440
so we are reaching out to all

247
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,520
our international partners
for assistance.

248
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,840
There's been a lot of speculation
about the shot.

249
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,000
Do you have a confirmed distance?

250
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,360
Yes, indeed, um...

251
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,440
From the apartment block
where the shot was taken

252
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,760
to the hospital door
where Fest was hit is,

253
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,480
er... 3,815 metres.

254
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,720
Are you sure about that?

255
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,000
Because the world record for
a confirmed kill with a sniper rifle

256
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,720
is 3,540 metres.

257
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,400
Ukraine, 2023.

258
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,080
Did you retrieve the weapon?
No.

259
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,240
Right, so the sniper
took it with him.

260
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,720
This is the suspect leaving
the apartment building,

261
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,640
two minutes and 52 seconds
after the shot was fired.

262
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,800
But... er, sorry, where's the rifle?

263
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,880
He broke it down and put it
in the bag. Obviously.

264
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,600
Can we get dimensions, please?

265
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,520
The bag is less
than 60 centimetres tall.

266
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:37,200
So?
The Tac-50 barrel is 737 millimetres

267
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,800
and it's the shortest around
in this category.

268
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,080
The Denel barrel is
a full metre long.

269
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,440
The-The-The rifle's not in the bag.

270
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,640
If it was in the bag,
we'd see the barrel poking out.

271
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,520
He left it behind.

272
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,200
No, forensics found no trace
of a weapon at the scene.

273
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,840
When a sniper finds a rifle,

274
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,440
one that allows him
to make a shot at that distance,

275
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,480
that rifle is a keeper.

276
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,800
He's never going to leave it behind.

277
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,640
Which means he took it with him.

278
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,520
And if he took it with him,
then it has to be in that bag.

279
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,440
I'm not following, Bianca.

280
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,520
You said the bag isn't big enough?

281
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,600
Which means the rifle is bespoke.

282
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,320
The barrel came in two parts.
A...

283
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:21,400
barrel in two parts is
the gunmaker's holy grail.

284
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,880
If the rifling were out
the tiniest fraction,

285
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,120
it would compromise the shot.
It's impossible.

286
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:29,320
There's a gunmaker who's been
trying to do this for years.

287
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,720
His name is Norman Stoke.

288
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,880
Is Mr Stoke British?

289
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,440
Northern Irish.
Well...

290
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,560
I suppose they count as British,
for now.

291
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,640
Do we know where Mr Stoke is?

292
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,320
Can we get Special Branch
to scoop him up?

293
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,320
He's been on the run since
the Stockholm assassination in 2018.

294
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,400
How unfortunate.
But I have an asset.

295
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,840
I know I can find him.

296
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,000
What good would that do us?

297
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,520
Oh, well, gunmaker makes gun.

298
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,880
Gunmaker sells gun to assassin.

299
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,080
Highly speculative.
It is a lead, however.

300
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,360
And, to be frank,
we don't have many of those.

301
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,480
Bonjour.
Bonjour.

302
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,840
Bianca. A moment, please.

303
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,680
It's always flattering
when the Germans come asking

304
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,880
for our expertise.

305
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,960
Although it would be
a little embarrassing

306
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,440
if the gunmaker turns out
to be British.

307
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,600
Who exactly is this Norman Stoke?

308
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,160
Stoke started making machine-guns
for loyalist paramilitaries

309
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,880
back in the '80s in East Belfast.

310
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,120
Norman and his brother Larry,
killed more than a dozen

311
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,200
innocent Catholic civilians.

312
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,360
Larry was eventually caught
and went to prison

313
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,080
but was released
under the peace agreement.

314
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,640
Er, he's now an enforcer
for a gang of drug dealers.

315
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,760
Norman, meanwhile,
perfected his craft

316
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:28,200
and made the gun used
in the Stockholm assassination.

317
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,760
How would you go about
finding Norman Stoke?

318
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,280
I have an asset in Belfast.

319
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,280
Codename Sparrow.

320
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,880
I've heard good things
about you, Bianca.

321
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,960
Don't let me down.

322
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,920
Yeah.

323
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,680
Hey.
Hey.

324
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,400
You look like you're at an airport.

325
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,240
Yeah, sorry.
But what about parents' evening?

326
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,760
So, I'm assuming you're not coming?

327
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,800
It's a last-minute thing.

328
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,120
You know, she's really
worked her socks off this term.

329
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:50,280
I know, I know. I feel awful about
it. There was nothing I could do.

330
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,680
Well, you could try
telling her yourself?

331
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,320
Paul, I can't, I can't.
I-I've just got to Belfast

332
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,480
and I'm-I'm already late
for a meeting.

333
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,800
Right, OK.
Can you do it, please?

334
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,760
OK.
Look, I will try my best

335
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,880
to get on the last flight.
OK.OK?

336
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,480
I'm sorry.
Alright, bye, bye.

337
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,680
OK, bye.

338
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,640
When I saw your number,
I almost had a stroke.

339
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,640
Thought I'd seen the last of you.

340
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,800
It has been a long time.

341
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
How've you been?

342
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,840
What do you want, Nadine?
How's the family?

343
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,000
Leave my family out of it.

344
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,560
If Larry knew who I was talking to,
he'd kill me.

345
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,920
There you go.
Thanks ever so much.

346
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,640
Do come back and see us.

347
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,960
Have a good day.

348
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,120
But you're being careful?

349
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:38,040
You remember the protocols?
Yes.

350
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,160
Good.

351
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,640
Then there's nothing
for you to worry about.

352
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,000
When was the last time Larry
spoke to his brother, Norman?

353
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,960
Not since he disappeared.

354
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,400
Are you telling me
the truth, Alison?

355
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:59,760
I know the brothers are close
and I need to find Norman now.

356
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Not my problem.

357
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,120
It's very much your problem,

358
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,280
because if you don't help me
find Norman,

359
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,840
you'll go back to prison.

360
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,280
Are you married?

361
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,240
No.
Children?

362
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,640
Nope.
Career woman.

363
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,560
It's written all over you.

364
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:34,880
If you had a husband, you'd know
men have their little secrets.

365
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,960
Well, this is a little secret
I want in on.

366
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,800
I need you to find out
where Norman is today.

367
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,800
I can't just ask Larry out the blue.

368
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,480
He'll be suspicious.
I'd have to work up to it.

369
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,560
You've got my number.

370
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,280
I expect to hear from you tonight.

371
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,360
Can I go now?

372
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,440
It's a free country.

373
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,520
This is Alison.
Leave a message.

374
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:01,800
Alison, it's Nadine.

375
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:05,280
I haven't heard from you
and I'm very disappointed. Call me.

376
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,240
Nadine?

377
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,680
Oh, office in-joke.

378
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,240
Look, baby, I'm so sorry.

379
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,840
You know, about parents' evening.
I really am.

380
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,320
Don't turn around.

381
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,280
Did you come alone?

382
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,120
Yes, I followed
your instructions to the letter.

383
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,560
Who's the target?

384
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,160
Ulle Dag Charles. UDC.

385
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,280
Can you get to him?

386
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,920
It'll cost.

387
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,560
I mentioned a guide price
of ten million dollars.

388
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,960
Multiply that by ten and then
perhaps we can have a conversation.

389
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,360
That's a very expensive
conversation.

390
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,240
Half on commission,
half on completion.

391
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,160
All reasonable expenses paid.

392
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,440
Well, I'd have to consult
my colleagues about that.

393
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,840
Hello?

394
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,040
Alison, it's Nadine. You were
supposed to call me last night.

395
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,080
I need to hear from you.

396
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,360
Er, get me everything we have
on Alison's daughter, Emma.

397
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,400
- Copy.
- Yeah?
Yeah, yeah. On it.

398
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,920
The BND believe, er...

399
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,120
The BND believe our sniper
thought he'd find Manfred

400
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:36,920
at the Fest Und Fest Unternehme
offices the night before.

401
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:41,000
But Manfred wasn't there
so he shot his son, Elias.

402
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,320
Manfred was always the real target.

403
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:48,080
Elias was used as bait
to lure Manfred to the hospital.

404
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,280
That would take
a lot of pre-planning.

405
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,480
Well, all planning is pre.

406
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,560
How did Belfast go?

407
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,360
My asset isn't cooperating.

408
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:02,000
I think we have to get
creative on this one.

409
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,840
She has a daughter, Emma.

410
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,920
A student in London.

411
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,760
Involved in a radical leftist group.

412
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,320
I think I can see where
you're going with this.

413
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:16,120
We have to be very careful

414
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:18,640
about sanctioning
this kind of operation.

415
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,920
CROWD
UDC! UDC! UDC! UDC!

416
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,600
What do we want?!
The truth about money!

417
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,800
When do we want it?
Now!

418
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,280
UDC! UDC! UDC!

419
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:39,520
River's here to make it clear!

420
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,000
You can't wash
your money here!

421
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,680
UDC! UDC! UDC! UDC!

422
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,640
Yep, that's her in the pink scarf.

423
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,960
Do I have to wait for her to act up?

424
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:51,960
No. Just go get her.

425
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:54,000
Fine by me.

426
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,040
Miss, you're causing
an obstruction in a public highway.

427
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:08,840
If you do not get up and move
right now, you're liable for arrest.

428
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:11,160
Why don't you go
and do something useful

429
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:13,240
like arrest the fat cats...

430
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:16,880
You can't wash your money here!

431
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,360
I'm not threatening you, miss.
Well, OK, well you should try

432
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:22,080
being where I am...

433
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:24,160
That's a threat.
It's a threat to me.

434
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,400
I'm being reasonable.
I'm not raising my voice

435
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,400
in the way that you are.

436
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,480
I don't care about your law,
I don't care!

437
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,720
Right, that's enough.
Have 'em up. Thank you!

438
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:44,160
Get your hands off me, lackey!

439
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:47,280
Whose streets?!
Our streets!

440
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:58,480
Whose streets?!
Our streets!

441
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,680
Whose streets?!
Our streets!

442
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,880
You're in very serious trouble,
Emma.

443
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:16,920
You're in very serious trouble.

444
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,960
We have four witnesses who saw you

445
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,720
throw the bottle
at the police officer.

446
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,000
We got four witnesses

447
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,840
who saw you throw the bottle
at the police officer.

448
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,600
What bottle?

449
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:32,840
What are you talking about?
Nobody was throwing anything.

450
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:35,080
You didn't even ask
about the officer.

451
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:37,680
She was badly hurt.
I didn't throw any bottle.

452
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,760
The officer's gonna lose
her right eye.

453
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:44,200
She's gonna lose her right eye,
since you didn't ask.

454
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,640
Just a young woman,

455
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:49,000
doing her job.

456
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,800
How's that make you feel, Emma?

457
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:54,360
You're making this up.

458
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,800
So fuck right off.

459
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,960
And I want a solicitor.

460
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,600
I have a right to a solicitor.

461
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:04,120
You can call your mother.

462
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,040
You can call your mother.

463
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,880
This way, please.

464
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,320
Fuck off me!
Get in there.

465
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,560
Where's my solicitor?!

466
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:43,280
Where's my solicitor?!
This is illegal!

467
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,080
Oh, my God!

468
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,480
I wasn't expecting you
until next week.

469
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:22,000
What and miss Carlito's birthday?
Not happening.

470
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,640
Talk to me.
She was like this when I found her.

471
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,320
She's still alive.
I've called the paramedics.

472
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:47,840
"At the tone,
please record your message."

473
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:49,840
Bianca,

474
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:52,480
we've got a serious problem
with your student.

475
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,000
What the fuck is going on?
She collapsed.

476
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,360
They think it's a cardiac issue.
They've stabilised her.

477
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,400
They think she's gonna make it.

478
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,520
I'm the accompanying officer.

479
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,880
Emma. Hang on, OK?

480
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,760
