They send Oda to scare Echo away.

173

[Oda] Yes, Elder.

174
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:11,750

But in Caesar's time,there were vast herds of them.

382
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:24,917
Can you imagine? [chuckles]

383
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,542
Perhaps here,humans were cared for, fed...

384
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:33,500
maybe even taught. [laughs]

385
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,083
What is it?

386
00:44:42,958 --> 00:44:44,125
Echo.

387
00:44:48,458 --> 00:44:49,500
Human.

388
00:44:52,292 --> 00:44:53,833
You have seen one?

389
00:44:54,667 --> 00:44:55,667
One.

390
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,667
They are scavengers.

391
00:44:59,833 --> 00:45:01,542
Like boars.

392
00:45:01,708 --> 00:45:03,333
Only lesser.

393
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,542
Humans are slow-witted, but...

394
00:45:08,708 --> 00:45:10,250
there was a time...

395
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:15,083
when humans and apes lived side by side.

396
00:45:17,125 --> 00:45:18,917
[Raka chuckles]

397
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,250
Yes, it is a puzzle. I know. But...

398
00:45:25,583 --> 00:45:28,333
they were important to Caesar. Hmm.

399
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:32,667
So they are important to me.

400
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:39,250
I have to get to my horse.

401
00:45:40,542 --> 00:45:42,083
Of course.

402
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:43,417
Follow me.

403
00:45:47,125 --> 00:45:49,792
You do not know Caesar.

404
00:45:51,292 --> 00:45:53,667
You do not know books.

405
00:45:57,708 --> 00:45:59,667
You should stay here.

406
00:45:59,833 --> 00:46:02,292
There is much I could teach you.

-No! Come back!-Pest!

411
00:46:13,958 --> 00:46:16,083
[Raka] Wait! Come back!

412
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,875
There is no danger.

413
00:46:20,833 --> 00:46:22,917
That is the one.

414
00:46:23,083 --> 00:46:25,500
Stole from my village.

415
00:46:26,875 --> 00:46:30,292
She follows you from your village?

416
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,750
Perhaps Caesar bids me travel.

417
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:45,500
Wait here. The work continues.

418
00:46:45,667 --> 00:46:46,833
I have no time for...

419
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,167
I will not slow you down.I, too, keep a horse.

420

00:46:57,458 --> 00:47:00,167
Can we not slow down?

423
00:47:00,333 --> 00:47:01,333
No.

424
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,458
I am sure she follows.

425
00:47:06,625 --> 00:47:07,958
I do not know why.

My father's bird.

430
00:47:23,833 --> 00:47:25,708
He follows to taunt me.

431
00:47:26,958 --> 00:47:30,750
This bird follows you too?

432
00:47:32,292 --> 00:47:35,208
We raise eagles, my clan.

433
00:47:35,958 --> 00:47:37,000
Sing to them...

434
00:47:37,958 --> 00:47:39,375
so they know us.

435
00:47:39,542 --> 00:47:40,708
A bond.

436
00:47:42,875 --> 00:47:44,208
Sing the song.

437
00:47:45,167 --> 00:47:46,375
Please.

438
00:47:49,708 --> 00:47:50,708
No.

439
00:47:52,708 --> 00:47:54,667
My father was Master of Birds.

440
00:47:54,833 --> 00:47:56,333
He sang to eagles.

441
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,500
But I am not him.

442
00:48:02,458 --> 00:48:03,458
Shame.

443
00:48:04,875 --> 00:48:07,917

Noa.

450
00:49:19,292 --> 00:49:22,292
She follows because she is hungry.

This is...

455
00:49:38,125 --> 00:49:39,625
important.

456
00:49:41,167 --> 00:49:43,333
They get cold.

457
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,083
Show mercy.

458
00:50:10,083 --> 00:50:12,458
She is smarter than most.

459
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:21,333
We will name her Nova.

460
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:26,375
We name them all Nova.

461
00:50:27,417 --> 00:50:30,417
I do not know why.It is from Caesar's time.

462
00:50:31,375 --> 00:50:36,208
Why did Caesar care so much for Echoes?

463
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:41,417
Legend says he was reared by them...

464
00:50:42,958 --> 00:50:45,417
impossible as that may seem.

465
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,125
Caesar legend is important.

466
00:50:51,125 --> 00:50:53,542
He was first Elder.

467
00:50:55,083 --> 00:50:57,958

471
00:51:13,167 --> 00:51:16,333
Caesar never had to share camp...

It was in her eyes.

She...

487

reacted.

488
00:54:43,375 --> 00:54:44,375
How?

489
00:54:47,917 --> 00:54:49,667
As ape would.

Is most unfortunate that the humancan only use its feet for walking.

498
00:55:48,333 --> 00:55:50,792
Imagine if you were falling from a tree.

You only have two appendagesto save your life.

That ape cannot have what is inside the...

792
01:24:44,042 --> 01:24:47,167
You gotta stop thinkingabout the way things were

and start thinking about the way they are.

01:24:50,250 --> 01:24:51,708
This is a good life,

795

and you have a chance to be a part of it.

796

What, and build a world for the apes?

797

833

you are familiar with the concept of...

That is the human label, yeah?

843
01:28:04,542 --> 01:28:09,000
The advancementthat I crave requires time.

844

You don't understand.

01:28:36,667 --> 01:28:38,083
In their time,

853
01:28:38,250 --> 01:28:43,875
humans were capableof many great things, yes?

854
01:28:44,042 --> 01:28:46,292
They could level mountains.

855
01:28:48,083 --> 01:28:50,500
They could speak across oceans.

856
01:28:50,667 --> 01:28:53,250
They could fly, Noa.

857
01:28:53,792 --> 01:28:55,625

my apes did not realize their value,

874
01:29:53,708 --> 01:29:57,333
so I was brought only bodies.

875
01:29:58,208 --> 01:30:02,625
I could not speak to themlike I can speak to you.

876

And I will get inside.

Now, can you tell me...

890
01:30:51,083 --> 01:30:55,125
did Mae tell youhow to get inside my vault?

01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:01,917

[Noa] You did not come for Echoes.

956

And you were not alone.

957
01:37:23,125 --> 01:37:24,208
[Mae] I'm sorry.

958
01:37:26,792 --> 01:37:29,208
Proximus's apes found our camp.

959
01:37:31,875 --> 01:37:33,417
They killed everyone.

960
01:37:34,792 --> 01:37:36,750
I barely escaped.

961
01:37:37,667 --> 01:37:39,458
I needed your help.

962

-And I was afraid.-The more you speak,

963

the less I believe.

964
01:37:45,417 --> 01:37:47,333
I was wrong not to trust you.

965
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:48,500
And I know that now.

966
01:37:48,667 --> 01:37:51,792
I trust you only to help yourself.

967
01:37:54,167 --> 01:37:56,625
But that could help me now.

968
01:38:00,958 --> 01:38:02,417
I have questions.

969
01:38:03,792 --> 01:38:05,333
You answer true,

970
01:38:06,167 --> 01:38:07,542
maybe I help.

What do you need inside vault?

972
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:16,500
It's...

973
01:38:17,417 --> 01:38:18,625
like a book.

974
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:21,167

976
01:38:25,042 --> 01:38:27,792
Humans lost their ability to speak.

977
01:38:27,958 --> 01:38:29,708
And this book might bring it back.

978
01:38:31,375 --> 01:38:33,167
A book can do this?

979
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,250
This one can.

980
01:38:42,667 --> 01:38:47,250
Raka said apes and humans

981

True or not true?

983
01:38:57,292 --> 01:38:58,458
Apes were silent.

984
01:39:00,208 --> 01:39:01,417

985
01:39:03,083 --> 01:39:04,667
Humans were dominant.

988
01:39:11,292 --> 01:39:12,917
It made apes smarter.

989
01:39:14,292 --> 01:39:16,292
And it almost killed all of us.

990
01:39:23,167 --> 01:39:25,875
You know a way inside, yes?

991
01:39:27,542 --> 01:39:28,542
Yes.

992
01:39:30,125 --> 01:39:31,917
One last question.

993
01:39:35,083 --> 01:39:39,333

1007

We're gonna need all of this.

1008

Follow me.

1009
01:41:56,083 --> 01:41:57,250
