Echoes only bring trouble.

151
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:32,417
Oda will chase the pests away.

152
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:42,917
May I seek your counsel?

153
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:50,292

They send Oda to scare Echo away.

173
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:07,875
[Oda] Yes, Elder.

174
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:11,750

00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:24,917
Can you imagine? [chuckles]

383
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,542
Perhaps here,humans were cared for, fed...

384
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:33,500
maybe even taught. [laughs]

385
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,083
What is it?

386
00:44:42,958 --> 00:44:44,125
Echo.

387
00:44:48,458 --> 00:44:49,500
Human.

388
00:44:52,292 --> 00:44:53,833
You have seen one?

389
00:44:54,667 --> 00:44:55,667
One.

390
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,667
They are scavengers.

391
00:44:59,833 --> 00:45:01,542
Like boars.

392
00:45:01,708 --> 00:45:03,333
Only lesser.

393
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,542
Humans are slow-witted, but...

394
00:45:08,708 --> 00:45:10,250
there was a time...

395
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:15,083
when humans and apes lived side by side.

396
00:45:17,125 --> 00:45:18,917
[Raka chuckles]

397
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,250
Yes, it is a puzzle. I know. But...

398
00:45:25,583 --> 00:45:28,333
they were important to Caesar. Hmm.

399
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:32,667
So they are important to me.

400
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:39,250
I have to get to my horse.

401
00:45:40,542 --> 00:45:42,083
Of course.

402
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:43,417

You do not know books.

405
00:45:57,708 --> 00:45:59,667
You should stay here.

406
00:45:59,833 --> 00:46:02,292
There is much I could teach you.

[Raka] Wait! Come back!

412
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,875
There is no danger.

413
00:46:20,833 --> 00:46:22,917
That is the one.

414
00:46:23,083 --> 00:46:25,500
Stole from my village.

415
00:46:26,875 --> 00:46:30,292
She follows you from your village?

416
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,750
Perhaps Caesar bids me travel.

417
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:45,500
Wait here. The work continues.

418
00:46:45,667 --> 00:46:46,833
I have no time for...

419
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,167
I will not slow you down.I, too, keep a horse.

No.

424
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,458
I am sure she follows.

425
00:47:06,625 --> 00:47:07,958
I do not know why.

430

He follows to taunt me.

431
00:47:26,958 --> 00:47:30,750
This bird follows you too?

432
00:47:32,292 --> 00:47:35,208
We raise eagles, my clan.

433
00:47:35,958 --> 00:47:37,000
Sing to them...

434
00:47:37,958 --> 00:47:39,375
so they know us.

435
00:47:39,542 --> 00:47:40,708

436
00:47:42,875 --> 00:47:44,208
Sing the song.

437
00:47:45,167 --> 00:47:46,375
Please.

438
00:47:49,708 --> 00:47:50,708
No.

439
00:47:52,708 --> 00:47:54,667
My father was Master of Birds.

440
00:47:54,833 --> 00:47:56,333
He sang to eagles.

441
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,500
But I am not him.

442
00:48:02,458 --> 00:48:03,458
Shame.

443
00:48:04,875 --> 00:48:07,917

Noa.

450
00:49:19,292 --> 00:49:22,292
She follows because she is hungry.

00:49:38,125 --> 00:49:39,625
important.

She is smarter than most.

459
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:21,333
We will name her Nova.

460

We name them all Nova.

I do not know why.It is from Caesar's time.

462
00:50:31,375 --> 00:50:36,208
Why did Caesar care so much for Echoes?

463
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:41,417
Legend says he was reared by them...

464
00:50:42,958 --> 00:50:45,417
impossible as that may seem.

465
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,125

He was first Elder.

471
00:51:13,167 --> 00:51:16,333
